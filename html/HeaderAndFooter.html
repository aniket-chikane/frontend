        <p>Round 1

            Variation of palindrome (I didn't do well here in terms of coding style. My interviewer focused on ways I could simplify my logic. I tried my best to figure this out on my own, but he ended up providing his version and I saw that it was clearer)
            Rotating Cypher (Same thing here, except I was asked to optimize for the memory of the keys. I didn't catch the hint entirely until when we finished the interview)
            Coming out of this round I felt like I had done poorly in missing some of these practical improvements to my solutions. I rated my performance as the worst one of the bunch
            
            Round 2
            
            Variation of K largest
            Variation of Maximal Spanning Tree (I think)
            Almost fumbled this interview from the start due to nerves. However, got back on track and made all the changes that interviewer wanted / bonus attempts.
            
            Overall, I thought my coding rounds were okay. I anticipated needing a follow-up depending on how the interviewer rated my 1st round performance</p>
